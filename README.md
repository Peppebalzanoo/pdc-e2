# Parallel and Distributed Computing
Exercise 1 v2
### The following exercise aims to solve the "Sum of N Numbers" problem in a parallel computing environment with MIMD-SM architecture using OpenMP
The parallel computing environment used for solving the problem employs MIMD-SM architecture (Multiple Instruction Multiple Data - Shared Memory). 

Specifically, given $a_0, ..., a_{n−1}$ ∈ R, the sum S of the $a_i$ is defined as: <br>
<p align="center"> $S = a_0+,...,+a_{n-1}\ =\ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i$</p>
